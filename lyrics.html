            I'm an ocean in your bedroom
            Make you feel warm
            Make you want to reassume
            Now we know it all for sure
            
            I'm a dancehall, dirty break beat
            Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
            Not alone, I'll be there
            Tell me when you want to go
            
            I'm a meth lab, first rehab
            Take it all off and step inside the running cab
            There's a love that knows the way
            
            I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
            All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
            Not alone, I'll be there
            Tell me when you want to go
            
            Oh (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
            Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
            Come again, get me excited (more will be revealed, my friend)
            
            I'm an inbred and a pothead
            Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
            Now we know it all for sure
            
            I could show you to the free field
            Overcome and more will always be revealed
            Not alone, I'll be there
            Tell me when you want to go
            
            Oh, and (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
            Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
            Come again, get me excited (more will be revealed, my friend)
            
            Oh, and (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
            Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
            There's a match, now let me light it (more will be revealed, my friend)
            
            I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
            Coming down and more, coming to believe
            Now we know it all for sure
            
            Make the hair stand up on your arm
            Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
            Not alone, I'll be there
            Tell me when you want to go
            
            I'll be there, tell me when you want to go
            Come again, and tell me when you want to go
            More will be revealed my friend
